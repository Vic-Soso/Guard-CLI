# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project follows semantic versioning once published.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Inline `// soroban-guard: allow(check-name)` suppression annotations.
- `examples/all-findings` demo contract that intentionally triggers every default check.
- crates.io publishing metadata and release process documentation.
- Documentation for the `forbidden-std-imports` check.

### Fixed

- `unsafe-storage-patterns`: `Symbol::new` detection now matches the last two
  path segments, so the fully-qualified `soroban_sdk::Symbol::new(...)` form is
  caught, not just the two-segment `Symbol::new(...)`.
- `unsafe-storage-patterns`: the dynamic-key check for `Symbol::new`'s second
  argument now resolves whether a path actually refers to a `const`/`static`
  item instead of guessing from identifier casing, so a lowercase-named
  constant is no longer misflagged and an upper-cased caller-controlled
  parameter is no longer missed.
- `mutable-global-state`: now finds `static mut` at any nesting — inside
  blocks (including `unsafe {}`), free functions, and trait impls — via a
  full `syn::visit` walk, instead of only the shapes a hand-rolled recursion
  anticipated.
- `mutable-global-state`: dropped its own copy of the `#[cfg(test)]`
  detection helper (which only matched a bare `#[cfg(test)]`) in favor of the
  shared one in `util.rs`, now taught to also recognize `test` nested inside
  `all(...)`/`any(...)`, e.g. `#[cfg(all(test, not(target_arch = "wasm32")))]`.
